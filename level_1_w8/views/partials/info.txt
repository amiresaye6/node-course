what are partials

they are parts of html code that we want to suer in multible view >> file with .ejs extension

the views are serverside renderd, which means it is runs in the server then returns to the client
the final version of the html page after modification if found


partials are in the partials directory inside the views directory for ejs and views engin to work


we use them like so in .ejs files


<%- include('./relative/path/to/the/partial/file.ejs) %>

nots about the <% js code here won't be seen in the html file, its only js code that will run %>


<%=  any thing here willl appear in the htl file , wheather it is a variable or anything %>
